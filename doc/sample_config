# The 'init' subcommand will automatically generate a ".bashtickets" directory
# containing a "config" file such as this one (in fact, it will be a copy of
# this file, unless you specify a different one via the "--config" option at the
# time of initialization).
#
# The config file's format is simple: it is a normal file containing bash
# variable assignments, and the file will be sourced directly to use these
# variables in other commands as needed. Some variables are simple bash
# variables, whereas others (the ones used to define choices in interactive
# menus) are effectively standard bash arrays containing string elements.
