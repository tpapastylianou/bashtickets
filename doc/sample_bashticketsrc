# This config should contain a list of projects, one per line, in the following
# format: <identifier> <one or more spaces> <path>
#
# e.g.
#
# name1 /path/to/project1
# name2 /path/to/project2
#
# ... etc
#
# Valid names should consist only of alphanumeric characters and underscores.
#
# Empty lines, or lines starting with a '#' are ignored
#
# Project paths should be valid paths, that have been initialised via bt init,
# and thus contain a 'tickets' directory and a 'milestones' directory.
#
# Note: you can specify the same path under different identifiers if you like.
# This may be useful if you want to call one of your projects 'default' for
# instance. Note that the 'default' identifier is not treated specially, it is
# just another identifier.
