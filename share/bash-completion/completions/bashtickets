# bashtickets completion

# This file should either be copied in your system-defined place where other
# such completion scripts reside, such as /usr/share/bash-completion/completions
# or /etc/bash_completion.d (check which one is called by your .bashrc file).
#
# Alternatively, simply 'source' it in your .bashrc file.

## If you would like autocompletion to work with aliases as well, define them
## separately here.
##
## For example, to generate autocompletion for an alias called 'bt', uncomment
## the line below:

#complete -F _bashtickets bt


# Alternatively, you can simply add such extra lines directly in your .bashrc
# file, alongside their alias definitions.
