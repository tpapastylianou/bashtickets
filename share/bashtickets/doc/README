# The 'init' subcommand will automatically generate a ".bashtickets" directory
# containing a "config" file like the one in this directory (in fact, it will be
# a copy of this particular sample_config file, unless you specify a different
# one via the "--config" option at the time of initialization).
#
# The config file's format is simple: it is a normal file containing bash
# variable assignments, and the file will be sourced directly to use these
# variables in other commands as needed. Some variables are simple bash
# variables, whereas others (the ones used to define choices in interactive
# menus) are effectively standard bash arrays containing string elements.
#
# The directory also contains the ticket and milestone template files used to
# create new tickets and milestones respectively.
