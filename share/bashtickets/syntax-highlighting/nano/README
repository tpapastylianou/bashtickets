To enable syntax highlighting of .ticket and .milestone files in nano, copy the
bashtickets.nanorc file provided here in a directory of your choice, and then
'include' that file in you .nanorc file.

A reasonable choice is to dump the file right into nano's directory containing
other existing syntax-highlighting files.

E.g. if your nano is installed in "/opt/nano-6.3.0" then you can do:

    cp bashtickets.nanorc /opt/nano-6.3.0/share/nano/extra/


and then make sure to uncomment the line:

    include "/opt/nano-6.3.0/share/nano/extra/*.nanorc"


in your .nanorc file.
