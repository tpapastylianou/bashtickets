To enable syntax highlighting in vim, copy the above two files in your vim
runtime directory, under their respective sub-directories (i.e. 'syntax' and
'ftdetect').

If the directories don't exist yet (e.g. 'ftdetect' probably does not if you've
never created custom syntax highlighting for custom file extensions before),
then you'll have to create it yourself.

E.g. assuming:

    VIMRUNTIME="/usr/share/vim/vim81"
    BT_ROOT_DIR="/opt/bashtickets"   # i.e. where you installed bashtickets. E.g. could instead be /usr or /usr/local.
    SYNTAXES="$BT_ROOT_DIR/share/bashtickets/syntax-highlighting"

Then you can do:

    # Create the syntax definition file for .ticket and .milestone filetypes
    sudo cp "$SYNTAXES/vim/syntax/bashtickets.vim" "$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/"

    # Enable autodetection of .ticket and .milestone filetypes in vim
    sudo mkdir "$VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect"   # only necessary if ftdetect does not already exist
    sudo cp "$SYNTAXES/vim/ftdetect/bashtickets.vim" "$VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect/"


If you prefer not creating an ftdetect directory, you can also simply dump the
contents of the 'ftdetect/bashtickets.vim' file straight into your .vimrc (note,
however, that, unfortunately you cannot do the same for the
'syntax/bashtickets.vim' file).
