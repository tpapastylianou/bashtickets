 - A valid bashtickets repository directory should contain 3 things in order to be valid:
   - A 'tickets' directory
   - A 'milestones' directory
   - A .bashtickets.repo file, denoting this is a valid project. This may later be used to hold config options, but for now can be empty.

- Initially 'projects' were to be externally supported. However this was abandoned in favour of 'repository-based' functionality, e.g. like git.
